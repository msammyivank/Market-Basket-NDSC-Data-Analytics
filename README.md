# Market-Basket-NDSC-Data-Analytics
The National Data Science Competition (NDSC) was a nationwide Data Science competition conducted by Shopee, one of the biggest E-Commerce companies in South East Asia. It was conducted online through Kaggle for all Indonesian data enthusiasts to follow. Not limited to Data Science, the competition actually also consist of Data Analysis tasks that didn't require any kind of machine learning or deep learning.

The challenge was to find **association rules** between combinations of products. These rules can help give a notion of regularities in the purchasing behaviors of users. For example, if someone were to buy Product A, what is the chance that the same person would also buy Product B at the same time? The tendency of this is measured by **Confidence**. The competition required the identification of 14328 different relationships with 2 up until 3 different products with differing relationships.

## The Results
I myself joined the competition with 3 other people with links to their LinkedIn profiles written at the end of this Readme. 5 hours was given but we weren't able to construct an efficient enough code to process the program before the competition ended, so we didn't win at that time. In spite of the loss, weeks later I decided to pursue it myself and created a python notebook consisting of the required syntax to finally acquire an accuracy of 100% through the submission of Kaggle in approximately 35 minutes. The notebook consists of functions, multi-index dataframes, and lambda functions in loops in order to iterate through the whole dataset.
