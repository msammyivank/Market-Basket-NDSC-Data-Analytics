The National Data Science Competition (NDSC) was a nationwide Data Science competition conducted by Shopee, one of the biggest E-Commerce companies in South East Asia. It was conducted online through Kaggle for all Indonesian data enthusiasts to follow. Not limited to Data Science, the competition actually also consist of Data Analysis tasks that didn't require any kind of machine learning or deep learning.

The challenge was to find **association rules** between combinations of products. These rules can help give a notion of regularities in the purchasing behaviors of users. For example, if someone were to buy Product A, what is the chance that the same person would also buy Product B at the same time? The tendency of this is measured by **Confidence**. The competition required the identification of 14328 different relationships with 2 up until 3 different products with differing relationships.
